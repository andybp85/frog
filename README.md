# GFrog

This fork allows you to load Docs in a Google Drive folder. Instead of Bootstrap/jQuery, the template utilizes [CSS Grid](https://learncssgrid.com/#naming-positioning-items-grid-areas) for the layout, [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) for the "structural" styles, and one stylesheet fo post styles that you can optionally write in [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) (requires [libsass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass)). There's also an optional [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) workflow to clean and inline the styles and minify everything.

[google-drive-racket](https://github.com/fgmart/google-drive-racket) provided much of the Google Docs access functionality, so much thanks to Prof. Martin!

### New Commands
* `-L` or `--load-from-gdocs`: Load new posts from Google Drive.
* `-F` or `--finalizer-setup`: Set up the Node finalizer script.
* `-K` or `--skip-finalizer`: Skip the finalizer (for faster builds while editing the site)

## Google Drive
You need to define three params:
```
ga-client-id
ga-client-secret
ga-posts-folder
```
How you do so is up to you, but most importantly:

**DO NOT PUT THESE VALUES IN A PUBLIC REPO!!!**

So, putting them in your `frog.rkt` is a bad idea if you're going to put it on Github. You could, for example, put them in a separate file that's gitignore'd and import that file into `frog.rkt`. However, what you should do is use environment variables. I've defined some default env vars that GFrog will check for the required info. The env var names are params, so you can change them if you'd like to. Here's the defaults:

```
GFROG_GA_CLIENT_ID
GFROG_GA_CLIENT_SECRET
GFROG_GA_POSTS_FOLDER
```

Note that tokens are stored in files named with a hash of param `current-scheme/host`, so if this is changed you'll be prompted to log in again.

### Set Up Credentials
(mostly taken from a comment in [google-drive-racket](https://github.com/fgmart/google-drive-racket))
1. Go to Google Developers Console and make a project.
2. Go to Dashboard > Explore other services > Enable APIs and get credentials like keys.
3. Then Google Apps APIs > Drive API (and enable it).
4. Then in the left-column menu, Credentials.
5. Then Create credentials > Oauth client ID > Other.
6. Then copy the client ID and secret into the appropriate env vars.
7. In Google Drive, make a folder for your posts, and then copy the folder ID in its env var.

### Writing Posts in GDocs
GFrog will load the doc as HTML and strip out the GDocs-specific stuff, so just make a doc as you normally would. Some things that are too complex to replicate (like multiple columns) don't work.

Google Docs use a redirect for link hrefs, so when you load a post GFrog will parse the links and try to determine the actual URL from the redirect, then show you the original and parsed URL and ask if you'd like to accept it or put a different URL in.

Images are downloaded to and served from `img/`. Note that an image won't download again if one with the same name is already present in the folder.

GFrog uses the `description` field from the Google File object for `Tags` and `Date` (nothing for `Authors` at the moment), which it parses with a YAML parser. It needs at least `Date`, in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. For example:

```
tags: world, hello
date: 2019-01-03
```
(Yes, lowercase. It's easier to tell you this than to go back and deal with casing.)

To access the description field, select the document in Google Drive (don't open it), hit the info button `â“˜` on the top right, then click on the `Details` tab. The field is on the bottom with the placeholder text "Add a description".

Currently there's no syncing for stuff that gets removed from the Google Drive folder, so you'll have to delete the post from `_src/posts` (and images from `img/` if applicable) yourself. Same to re-parse a post you didn't touch on Google Docs/Drive or to re-download an image - just delete the local version.

## Sass

If you don't have [libsass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) installed, GFrog will just skip it and you can write your styles in `css/posts.css`. If you have it installed, you can write scss to `_src/scss/posts.scss` and GFrog will compile it into `css/posts.css` (note this will nuke out anything in `posts.css`). That's all there is to it!

Well, a little bit more: the file names are hard-coded for th moment. At some point I'll make GFrog compile whatever sass/scss files it finds in the `css/`. And if sass errors, you'll get a message but the build will keep running.

## Finalizer

**Requires Node.js v11.9.0+**

GFrog will try to install the Node deps during init. If you don't have Node installed or have <v11.9.0, the install won't run and GFrog won't bug you about it any further. You can turn it on later by enabling the param `node-available` and running the finalizer set up command. If all's well, you'll see the script `finalize.mjs` in your blog's root dir. I've also set up a `.gitignore` file with `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` skipped for you.

I'm a front-end guy by day and I'm using ES6 modules, hence the version req and `.mjs` extension. If this is an inconvenience because you don't do JS for a living and therefore aren't used to dealing with having more Node versions than system libs installed, do like we do and use the wonderful [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

The script is right there in your blog directory so feel free to modify to your heart's content! I had the idea to make this configurable besides just on/off, but this is how I want my files processed and I have no idea if anyone else will use this. So, if you want this feature, make me feel important and post an issue :)

### Packages and Process
* [uncss](https://github.com/uncss/uncss)
* [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss):
    * [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
    * [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/)
* [strip-css-comments](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-css-comments)
* [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier)

The full processing results in a minified HTML file with just the CSS styles present on the page inline in the `<head>`. Here's how:
1. After the regular Frog build process runs, each file is read into a string and run through uncss to generate another string of just the styles used in that file.
2. All comments are stripped from the resulting CSS string...
3. Which is then run through autoprefixer and cssnano via postcss for vendor prefix double-checking and minification.
4. The normal `<link>` CSS tags are stripped from the HTML string and the `<!-- CSS -->` comment is replaced with the CSS string.
5. The whole HTML string is minified and written over the file it was read from.

Note this runs after the file is generated, so if the script errors, the un-minified file will be left in place.

Frog is a static web site generator written in [Racket][].

You write content in [Markdown][] or [Scribble][]. You generate
files. To deploy, you push them to a GitHub Pages repo (or copy them
to Amazon S3, or whatever).

Posts get a variety of automatic blog features.

You can also create non-post pages.

[Pygments][] handles syntax highlighting for code blocks.

The generated site uses [Bootstrap][], which is [responsive][],
automatically adapting to various screen sizes.
