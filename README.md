# GFrog

This fork implements a command (`"-L"` or ``"--load-from-gdocs"``) to load new posts from a Google Docs folder. The template utilizes [CSS Grid](https://learncssgrid.com/#naming-positioning-items-grid-areas) and [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) (instead of Bootstrap/jQuery), as well as some [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) tooling to clean and inline the styles (requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to be available on the cli).

[google-drive-racket](https://github.com/fgmart/google-drive-racket) provided much of the Google Docs access functionality, so much thanks to Prof. Martin!

## To utilize Google Drive
You need to define three params:
```
ga-client-id
ga-client-secret
ga-posts-folder
```
How you do so is up to you, but most importantly:

**DO NOT PUT THESE VALUES IN A PUBLIC REPO!!!**

So, putting them in your `frog.rkt` is a bad idea if you're going to put it on Github. You could, for example, put them in a separate file that's gitignore'd and import that file into `frog.rkt`. However, what you should do is use environment variables. I've defined some default env vars that GFrog will check for the required info. The env var names are params, so you can change them if you'd like to. Here's the defaults:

```
GFROG_GA_CLIENT_ID
GFROG_GA_CLIENT_SECRET
GFROG_GA_POSTS_FOLDER
```

Note that tokens are stored in files named with a hash of param `current-scheme/host`, so if this is changed you'll be prompted to log in again.

### Set up credentials
(mostly taken from a comment in [google-drive-racket](https://github.com/fgmart/google-drive-racket))
1. Go to Google Developers Console and make a project.
2. Go to Dashboard > Explore other services > Enable APIs and get credentials like keys.
3. Then Google Apps APIs > Drive API (and enable it).
4. Then in the left-column menu, Credentials.
5. Then Create credentials > Oauth client ID > Other.
6. Then copy the client ID and secret into the appropriate env vars.
7. In Google Drive, make a folder for your posts, and then copy the folder ID in its env var.

### Writing posts in GDocs
GFrog will load the doc as HTML and strip out the GDocs-specific stuff, so just make a doc as you normally would. Some things that are too complex to replicate (like multiple columns) don't work.

Google Docs use a redirect for link hrefs, so when you load a post GFrog will parse the links and try to determine the actual URL from the redirect, then show you the original and parsed URL and ask if you'd like to accept it or put a different URL in.

Images are downloaded to and served from `/img/`. Note that an image won't download again if one with the same name is already present in the folder.

GFrog uses the `description` field from the Google File object for `Tags` and `Date` (nothing for `Authors` at the moment), which it parses with a YAML parser. It needs at least `Date`, in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. For example:

```
tags: world, hello
date: 2019-01-03
```
(Yes, lowercase.)

To access the description field, select the document in Google Drive (don't open it), hit the info button `â“˜` on the top right, then click on the `Details` tab. The field is on the bottom with the placeholder text "Add a description".

Currently there's no syncing for stuff that gets removed from the Google Drive folder, so you'll have to delete the post from `_src/posts` yourself (and images if applicable). Same to re-parse a post you didn't touch on Google Docs/Drive or to re-download an image - just delete the local version.

Frog is a static web site generator written in [Racket][].

You write content in [Markdown][] or [Scribble][]. You generate
files. To deploy, you push them to a GitHub Pages repo (or copy them
to Amazon S3, or whatever).

Posts get a variety of automatic blog features.

You can also create non-post pages.

[Pygments][] handles syntax highlighting for code blocks.

The generated site uses [Bootstrap][], which is [responsive][],
automatically adapting to various screen sizes.
